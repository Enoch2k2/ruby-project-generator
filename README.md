# Ruby Project Generator
### How it works
To generate a new ruby project type
```
ruby-generator new <project name>
```
It will create the barebone skeleton of a ruby project, with rspec installed. Also will run bundle install for you.

Note: You will need bundler installed.

To install bundler just type `gem install bundler`.
